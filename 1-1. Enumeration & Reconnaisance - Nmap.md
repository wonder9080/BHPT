## Nmap
1. fastscan
`nmap -p- --max-retries 1 -sS -Pn -n 172.31.233.31 -oA fastscan `
2. topports
`nmap --top-ports 1000 -sS -Pn -n 172.31.233.31 -oA topports`
3. detailed
`nmap -p 22,80 -sV -sC -Pn -n 172.31.233.31 -oA detailed `


#### Speed
```
T3 default T4 enough T5 too much 
```
```
--min-rate 3000 4000 5000  : 3000 packets per sec
when it's a little bit slow, 3000~4000 enough
```
1. the faster, the more we lose accuracy
2. the easier firewall block


- `-sC` : default scripts execute

- `--script smb*(.nse)`
    - ssh-auth-method
    - you can find and download scripts online as well: wordpress-theme-enum.nse
    - only with probable, relative services scripts
    - ? scripts category

`-sV`
banner grabbing 

`-Pn`
host discovery x, no ping. 
- nmap's default feature :  first of all, scan ping(ICMP) + 443 + 80 before the specific port scan. to know hosts's alive.
    - if one of them responses, it starts scanning.
    - problem is many hosts block ICMP >> so it judges this host is dead, and don't scan.

- and also in order to get faster.


`-n`
No DNS resolution, can slash scanning time


`-oA` 
output
- save in all format : 
    - xml-for parcing programmatically, 
    - nmap, 
    - gnmap - easy to greb specific ports


### TCP connect scan 
#### how nmap normally works
```
SYN>
<ACK+SYN
ACK> : let's build session
RST+ACK?> : nmap - no, we don't need, disconnect 
```

- when closed
```
??SYN>
<RST+ACK : target reponds- this port is closed, 
```


`-sS` (SYN scan, stealth)
```
SYN>
<ACK+SYN
RST+ACK?> : nmap - no 
```

- to get faster if there're many target ports, more than 10 times faster than than connect scan, so most of the time, to use SYN scan is better, 
    - but some network devices can't handle the unusual handshake, they get overload
    - also -sS can't get network information.(prevent banner grabbing)


#### other tools
- masscan or rustscan- million host's ips and then detailed 
- Bash/Powershell oneliner: after pen, when it's not able to use others, can use. 



`-sU` : udp scan, but don't use much 
- > UDP just 2: send and get, fast, without 3way 


- another scan(null, Fin, Xmas) = no practical. 


`--open`
- opened ports only, when I specified the ports, I don't wanna see filtered ports because when target host are too many, low readibility.
    - much use
    - opened: response running, can connect 
    - closed: no response
    - filtered: port is opened but firewall block or not, don't know. most of all due to firewall, can't connect 


- after 3way, how does it work?
```
SYN>
<ACK SYN
ACK> - sessions connected
<response from the host's port 
```



`-sn`
icmp scan = ping scan = -sn
- Host is up 
- icmp request , reply
